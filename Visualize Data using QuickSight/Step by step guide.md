### Steps:

1. Log in to the AWS account using Root user.

2. Search for S3 in services under Storage.

3. Click on Create Bucket, and name your bucket, it should be in lowercase and unique, and let all other things be at default.

4. I have provided the 'Dataset csv' file and 'JSON manifest' in this folder, you have to download it and upload it to your bucket
   **Note - Open the JSON file before uploading it, and in place of Bucket-Name use the name of your bucket.**

5. After uploading the files, open AWS Quicksight in a new tab, you can find Quicksight by searching it in AWS services.

6. Quicksight will ask you to create an account.

    + Click on the manifest file
    + Go to its properties
