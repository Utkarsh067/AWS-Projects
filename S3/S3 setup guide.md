Must start with a lowercase letter or number.

**5. Choose a Region (Optional):**

By default, AWS will choose a region closest to you for optimal performance.
You can select a different region if latency or data residency is a concern.

**7. Create Bucket:**

After reviewing your configuration (or leaving defaults for basic storage), click the orange "Create" button to create your S3 bucket.

**8. Accessing Your Bucket:**

Once created, your new S3 bucket will be listed in the S3 console.
You can view the bucket's properties, upload and manage objects within the bucket, and explore additional functionalities.

**9. Uploading files in a bucket**

Enter the bucket by clicking on the bucket's name.

Now, click on the 'Upload' button to upload files in a bucket.
