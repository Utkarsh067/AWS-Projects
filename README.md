# AWS-Projects

## what is AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services offered by Amazon, providing a broad set of global products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications. Launched in 2006, AWS enables businesses to rapidly provision new services without upfront costs, supporting scalability and flexibility to meet changing business requirements. Today, AWS operates a highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure platform in the cloud, serving hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries worldwide.

### Why we use AWS?
We use AWS because it offers increased speed and agility, reduced costs through its pay-as-you-go model, enhanced scalability to accommodate project needs without extra charges, improved security with features like IAM and VPCs, and global reach with over 60 Availability Zones in 21 regions, enabling us to efficiently develop and deploy cloud-native software.
